# RX1

The goal of this project is to build portable, and expansible flight software for hobby sized rockets.
While TVC is the pie in the sky, this repo will be setup so that a controller can be imported, but one won't be made publically available.

The main goals of the software are

- Telemetry
- Data logging 
- Parachute control
- State estimation
- Servo control
